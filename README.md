## Architecture

___


1. React was used to develop user interfaces and the frontend.
2. SCSS was used to develop the stylesheets of every UI and converge into one.
3. GitHUB RESTful API via Octokit was used to fetch GitHub-related data.
4. Extensions such as `@varandas/fetch-readme`, `react-markdown`, and `react-spinner` were used to develope other interfaces.
5. TypeScript was used as an extension with JS to minimize production bugs.
6. Heroku was used to deploy the production app.
